cyberrush map file format

lines that start with # are comments
no inline comments
no whitespace in all other lines
note: quotation marks here are used to show what line should say
actual line in map file shouldnt have any quotation marks in it

first 2 lines must be these:
first line,map size: "x,y" where x is the x size of the map, y is y size of the map, in number of zones
second line,map name: "mapname" where map name is the game of the map
after that we are in mapinfo state of map loading

in map info state:
	keyword setspawn
		line: "setspawn=x,y"
		where x and y are the coordinates of the zone that the player should spawn in when the map first loads
		
	keyword editzone
		line: "editzone=x,y"
		where x and y are the coordinates of the zone that you want to start editing
		this moves you to the zoneinfo state


in zone info state
	note:zones are a single screen of the map
	moving to the edge moves you to the next zone in that direction, if there is one
	keyword setbg
		line: "setbg=bgname"
		set the background of zone
		bgname should be the filename of the background
		the map loader will automatically look in the backgrounds folder for it
		bgname filename should include filename extension
		eg. setbg=city_bg.png
		
	keyword setmusic
		line: "setmusic=musicname"
		set the music to play in the zone
		musicname is the filename of the music
		map loader will automatically look in music folder for it
		must set this for every zone you want music in, even if the same music is already playing in another zone
		not including this in a zone will make the zone play no music
		if you go from 1 zone to another, and they both are playing the same music, the maploader will simply do nothing, so the music keeps playing, instead of restarting the music
		
	keyword setleftspawn
		line: "setleftspawn=x,y"
		sets the spawn when entering the zone from the left side of the screen
		x and y are coordinates on the screen, where 0,0 is the top left of the screen
	
	keyword setupspawn, setdownspawn, setrightspawn
		all the same as setleftspawn, except for their respective directions
	
	keyword endzone
		line: "endzone"
		stops editing current zone, and set map laod state back to map info
	
	keyword addenemy
		line: "addenemy"
		allows you to add an enemy to the screen
		changes current map load state to add enemy state
		note: in the future this may be changed to a different keyword for each type of enenmy
		for now though, since we only have 1(the hovering robot), just addenemy is fine
	
	keyword addcollidable
		line: "addcollidable"
		allows you to add a collidable object to the zone
		changes current map load state to add collidable state
	
	keyword addclutter
		line: "addclutter"
		allows you too add clutter(non collidable objects that simply add to the background of a map and make it look better) to the zone
		changes current map load state to add clutter state
		note: will not be implementing this right now
		can be implemented later on once we have more detailed maps to make them look a little better
		

in add enemy state
	note: for now, this is only for adding the hovering robot enemy, as that is the only one
	this may change in the future
	
	keyword setpos
		line: "setpos=x,y"
		sets the position of the enemy
		x and y are coordinates on the screen, where 0,0 is the top left of the screen
		
	keyword setendx
		line: "setendx=x"
		where x is the x coordinate that the enemy should stop moving too
		for the hovering enemy
	
	keyword setendy
		same as setendx but for y direction
		
	keyword endenemy
		line: "endenemy"
		stops editing current enemy and returns to zone info state
		note: make sure you have put in all the info needed, as you cant re-edit an enemy, only add new ones
		
in add collidable state
	note: for now, all collidables(platforms, etc.) will be pygame rects of a single color
	this is for simplicty while the map loader is being made
	in the future it will be able to load platforms with actual images
	possibly moving platforms as well
	
	keyword setpos
		line: "setpos=x,y"
		sets the position of the collidable
		x and y are coordinates on the screen, where 0,0 is the top left of the screen
		
	keyword setdims
		line: "setdims=x,y"
		sets the dimensions of the collidable
		x  is width and y is height
		
	keyword setcolor
		line: "setcolor=rrrgggbbb"
		where rrr, ggg, and bbb are the red green and blue color values of the collidable
		from 000 to 255
		note: attach leading 0's to numbers that are 1 or 2 digits in order to make the value 3 digits
		this is for ease of parsing
		
	keyword endcollidable
		line: "endcollidable"
		stops editing current collidable and returns to zone info state
		note: make sure you have put in all the info needed, as you cant re-edit a collidable, only add new ones
